List.java: List ADT doubly linked list used for storing integers. 
ListClient.java: Client that tests functionality.
Lex.java: Takes input file with strings and returns an output file in Lexicographic order using indirect sorting.
Makefile: Compiles every .java file in the directory. 

Lex.java takes an input and outfile on the command line. It then makes every line into a string and puts every string into an array. The array is then indirectly sorted using a doubly linked list storing the indices of the array. The sorted file is then printed to an output file.
